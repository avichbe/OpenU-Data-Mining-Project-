# OpenU-Data-Mining-Project-
my project in data mining course (20959) - final score 96.
the main goal - prediction qouality of wine
the data set given in the main folder. 
first file i described the preperations i made on the data set (as cleaning the data from noise and some extream edge case and more)
the second file describe the choosing of mining algorithems and prefering some above others(such as expectation maximization above DBScan and else). 
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

main conclusions:
strong concection between alochol to wine quoality and citric acid and wine quoality.
