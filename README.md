# OpenU-Data-Mining-Project-
my project in data mining course (20959) - final score 96.

the main goal - prediction quality of wine.

the data set given in the main folder. 

In the first file I described the preparations that I made on the data set (as cleaning the data from noises and some extreme edge case etc.)

the second file describe the choosing of mining algorithms and preferring some above others (such as expectation maximization above DB Scan and else). 

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid

4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

main conclusions:
strong connection between alcohol to wine quality and citric acid and wine quality.
